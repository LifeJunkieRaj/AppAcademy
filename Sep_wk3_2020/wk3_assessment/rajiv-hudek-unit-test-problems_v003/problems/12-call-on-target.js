/***********************************************************************
Write a function named `callOnTarget(fn, obj1, ob2)`. `callOnTarget` will
accept a function to invoke that will use the first passed in object, (obj1), as
the context for that function call and the second passed in object, (obj2), as
an argument being passed to the function upon invocation. Make sure to return the
invoked function with the correct context and arguments!

Take a look at the below examples for more clarity!

Examples:

const cat = {
  name: "Breakfast"
};

const mouse = {
  name: "Jerry"
};

function greet(other) {
  return "I'm " + this.name + ". Nice to meet you, " + other.name;
}

console.log(callOnTarget(greet, cat, mouse)); // "I'm Breakfast. Nice to meet you, Jerry"
console.log(callOnTarget(greet, mouse, cat)); // "I'm Jerry. Nice to meet you, Breakfast"

const dog = {
  name: "Noodles",
  chase: function(animal) {
    return "Woof, my name is " + this.name + " and I'm chasing " + animal.name;
  }
};

console.log(callOnTarget(dog.chase, cat, dog)); // "Woof, my name is Breakfast and I'm chasing Noodles"
